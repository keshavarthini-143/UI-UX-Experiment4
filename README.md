# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:

To create a wireframe for a mobile app with 5 main screens: Welcome, Login, Home, Jobs, and Post. The goal is to show how users move through the app.

## Algorithm:

1.Identify the purpose of the app (professional networking/job search).

2.Decide on the 5 main screens: Welcome, Login, Home, Jobs, and Post.

3.Plan the layout and content for each screen.

4.Use a design tool (not Balsamiq) to draw each screen as a wireframe.

5.Arrange elements like buttons, icons, search bars, and text fields clearly.

6.Connect screens to show the user flow from start to final action.

7.Review the wireframes to ensure they are simple and user-friendly.

## Output:

<img width="1337" height="545" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb31ff7e-caff-4b33-b575-ce832f990521" />


## Result:

A wireframe was made with 5 screens showing the app flow. It starts with a welcome page, then login, then shows the home screen, job listings, and a post screen for users to share content.
